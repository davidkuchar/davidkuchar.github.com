	<div class="content">
		<p>I'm a big fan of Nassim Taleb's work, and his latest, <a href="http://amzn.to/VJkzzc">Antifragile</a>, is no exception. As he puts it, he wrote this book to build on the concepts he laid out on his previous volumes, taking ideas for granted that he previously made efforts to rationalize. In a way, I'd compare Antifragile to Dawkins' <a href="http://amzn.to/UM11fy">The Extended Phenotype</a>. As <a href="http://amzn.to/VPQDz4">The Selfish Gene</a> had the burden of proving that the gene was the unit of evolutionary selection, he could write his second volume with the assumption that it's case has been made.</p>

<p>In Nassim's foundational work, <a href="http://amzn.to/WufEyo">The Black Swan</a>, he explains how improbable, unforeseen events account for the vast majority of change in the world. Since he's now shown how important these events are, he can write Antifragile, which is about how different types of objects and organizations fare in the face of a Black Swan.</p>

<p>Antifragile, the concept, isn't simply <em>robust</em>, which would describe something that is invulnerable to variation. It's something that is improved by unpredictable variation - think of a bridge that doesn't collapse from an earthquake but rather gets stronger - that bridge would be antifragile.</p>

<p>Antifragile is not always better. But in business, where the ecosystem is so complex that even the success/failure events that wouldn't seem to represent black swans may <em>appear</em> like black swans, antifragile is better. Investors, especially seed investors and incubators, take advantage of this by making small bets in a variety of fledgeling businesses, taking small losses on most choices, but participating in the big wins. It stands to reason that if Silicon Valley itself is antifragile, as Taleb suggests, then an "index fund" of it's best bets would exhibit similar or better properties.</p>

<p>While you could make an argument that Silicon Valley, and it's investors do benefit from powerful, unpredicted events, early stage, venture funded businesses typically exhibit fragile qualities. Most nowadays are pre-revenue and sometimes never find market fit or the growth in users required to justify follow-on financing.</p>

<p>If the focus of the business isn't wildly successful quickly, support will dry up, and changing that focus is costly in time and energy. It's a big, all-in bet, and if the bet is off, the company will likely die. And the odds aren't generally good - when my fellow founder-friends talk about odds, they usually quote a 1% chance of success.</p>

<p>Now, while the failure of any one business isn't ideal for investors, their loss is relatively small, and it makes logical sense for them to instead double down on the winners, rather than serve as a tourniquet, since the rewards for doing so are disproportionally large. However, to the business and it's founders, this failure is catastrophic.</p>

<p>So, if we agree that as is, fledgeling businesses are fragile, what would an antifragile business look like? Again, an antifragile business would not only survive the unexpected, but would stand some chance to greatly benefit from it. So while something like investing in real estate is relatively robust, it lacks explosive upside.</p>

<p>While at Startup School, Joel Spolsky talked about two ways to go in terms of starting a business: bootstrapping, and venture funding. Since he's succeeded using both strategies, his perspective is compelling. But is there something in between the two? Can you bootstrap with an eye towards an IPO? Can you balance big bets and keep the lights on even when those bets fail?</p>

<p>Since I started my journey in business, I've always thought that the only way to reasonably ensure success as an entrepreneur was to commit to getting as many at bats as possible. And to me, this meant starting a series of businesses, regardless of success. But maybe consistently picking up and starting over is more expensive than simply designing your organization to balance swinging for homeruns with the occasional single.</p>

<p>To me the best example of an organization doing this right is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rovio_Entertainment">Rovio</a>, who made a number of moderately successful games, that kept themselves in the business of making games, until they stumbled upon Angry Birds.</p>

<p>When you have a wildly successful game on your hands, you raise venture capital and you scale it. But starting out with the idea that the process of getting there is a direct one, seems to me like a fragile idea. Setting out to build Angry Birds on day one, to me sounds silly.</p>

<p>Games like Angry Birds are made by companies, but their runaway success isn't. It relies on many fortuitous events, most of which lying outside of your control all aligning at the right time, centered around your creation. To be antifragile, a business needs to be in the business of creating chances for itself to win.</p>
