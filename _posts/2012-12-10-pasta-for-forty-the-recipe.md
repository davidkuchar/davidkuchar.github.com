### Directions

#### Basic Pasta Sauce

1. Prep garlic, carrots, celery, onions.  Garlic should be crushed and diced.  Peel and dice onions.  Peel and dice carrots.  Clean and dice celery.  Onion/Carrots/Celery should all be in the same quantity, and they make up the [The Mirepoix][1].

2. In a pan that's big enough to fit everything prepared thus far, heat olive oil, garlic, chili pepper flakes.  Heat a few minutes, adjust heat and stir to make sure nothing burns. 

3. Add onion, coat with sea salt.  Cook until translucent, 5 mins or so.

4. Add carrots and celery, coat with sea salt.  Cook until translucent, maybe 10 or so minutes.  Keep stirring!

5. Add tomato paste and add some water as necessary to keep the mixture from drying out and burning.  Let tomato paste [caramelize][2].

6. Move entire mixture to a large pot.

7. Add entire bottle of wine and stir.  I usually just use $2 cab, but Italian varietals are preferable.  You'll want to cook the wine down until the steam stops reeking of alcohol.  I've found that if you don't cook off enough of the alcohol, people get acid reflux.  Keep stirring, at this point only add water if things start to dry out too much.

8. Prep your tomatoes.  Add all of them to a large separate bowl, and crush the whole tomatoes with your (clean) hands. If the tomatoes are hard to crush by hand, buy better tomatoes next time!

9. Add tomato mixture to the pot, stir them in, and reduce heat.  

10. Add a stick of butter.

11. Dice basil and parsley.  I like a handful of each when diced.  

12.  Add more salt, oregano, and thyme to taste.  Add bay leaves.

13.  Cover the pot, stir, add water as necessary, but most importantly give it time - hours at this stage if you can, as it just gets better with heat and time.

14. 15-30 minutes before you're ready to serve, boil water for the pasta.  Add a heaping handful of salt to each pot - this is your opportunity to season the pasta as it cooks.  

15. Once boiled, cook the pasta until almost al dente.  Then, drain the water and finish cooking the pasta IN the sauce.  It will absorb the sauce into the noodles, binding them better with the sauce and adding more flavor to the noodles.

#### Vodka Sauce

The vodka sauce starts with the basic sauce.  The following is how I turn roughly half of the basic sauce results above into a vodka sauce.

1. Choose a pot with as much surface area as possible.  Add vodka to sauce (stir it in).  Cook off the alcohol - it may take up to 30 minutes.  If you smell alcohol in the steam, keep cooking it.  If you don't cook off all the vodka it will taste sour - more cooking time solves this problem.

2. Add the heavy cream, let it heat through (3-5 mins).

3. Add parmesan cheese - I like to put in about 2 cups of it.  Let it all melt into the sauce.

4. Cook penne as you did the linguini, adding it to the vodka sauce at the end and serving it from the pot.
