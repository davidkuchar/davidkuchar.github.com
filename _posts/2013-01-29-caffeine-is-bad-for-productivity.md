do some research on this but it makes sense that we're too "stimulated" to calm down and work on more monotonous tasks when we're on caffiene.  also helps explain the ballmer curve, which also slows/dumbs you down.

brain gets bored of simple tasks when hyped up.  ironically need to be sedated to get shit done.
